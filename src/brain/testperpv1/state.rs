//! Reactive decision loop for a Phoenix-perp-funding-vs-lending-rate basis
//! trade -- mirrors `arbv1::state`/`phoenixperpsv1::state`'s shape
//! (same `StateHelper`/`CommitHook`/`evaluate` pattern). Feeds
//! `trader::perp_router::PerpRouter` from Phoenix's existing read-only
//! pricing data (`trader::dex::phoenix::PhoenixState`), closes out a
//! `GraphLayer` on real hourly epoch boundaries (`SystemTime::now()` --
//! confirmed already used and working in every other bot mode this
//! session, not a new/unverified capability), and logs the result.
//!
//! **Not** a Phoenix-vs-Velocity/Drift funding-rate arb (an earlier pass
//! this file went through) -- Drift's real order flow moved to an
//! off-chain "Swift" relayer this bot's WIT host interface can't reach,
//! so that path is retired. The second leg of every position here is a
//! deposit or borrow against a lending protocol -- Solend
//! (`trader::dex::solend`) or Kamino (`trader::dex::kamino`), whichever
//! offers the better rate for a given symbol (marginfi deferred -- its
//! cached prefetch data looked stale and a live re-fetch needs
//! infrastructure this environment doesn't have configured) -- not a
//! second perp venue. See `decide_basis_trade`'s doc comment for the real
//! trade structure.
//!
//! Also carries a spot-market execution hook (`o_dex`/`spot_router`,
//! `execute_spot_leg`), mirroring `arbv1::state`'s `o_dex`/`router`/
//! `build_execution_plan` pattern -- builds and can send a real
//! transaction. Used both by `rebalance_portfolio` and by this file's
//! Solend-hedge legs (swapping the underlying asset in/out of USDC).
